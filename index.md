# Lab 1: Akar's user page!

Hello! I'm Akar, a 2nd year computer engineering major in UCSD, and this is my user page.

## Technology background

Outside of the university's standard course track of a java/c++ based  
*intro to intermediate programming* -> *object-oriented design* -> *data structures* -> *algorithms*,  
I've ~~picked up~~ started learning a few other handy tech working on side projects in my free time:

- **Spreadsheets**
  - [Deducing item drop rates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZOzIo7fUP8GPo3ndwuKMm5qsrY3RfGGArfjjAMvokS4/edit?usp=sharing) (confidence interval) for Pokemon Go with self gathered data
  - [Champie icon collection manager](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jpb3MAUC26hteVGGBjupNSCXhpUiUBEKNTWxnJNjU1s/edit?usp=sharing) for tracking champie icons and finding the chance of getting the icon you want from mystery box (League of Legends)
  - Grade checkers for various classes [(Phys2C)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ix-ri9jUSPA7Bhvxy6awB3WjTBIWXqFlU0pOt3AoAiY/edit#gid=993853187), [(Cse105)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-H00Q7mR481_Mb3cV_ev4ud2YIPT79H6RXXwDPHn5qQ/edit?usp=sharing), etc.
- **Powershell**
  - [Script](https://github.com/maniacalhamster/setup_ssh/blob/master/setup_ssh.ps1) for setting up ssh keys and config file
  - [Another script](https://github.com/Breakout-Room-2/lol-tracker/blob/master/get_dev_key.ps1) for logging into a website to retrieve an api key
  - [Personal profile script](https://github.com/maniacalhamster/Preferences/blob/master/profile.ps1), defining aliases and functions I like to use
- **Android**
  - [Coursework](https://github.com/maniacalhamster/Codepath_AndroidStudio) revolving around creating mock versions of popular apps for an online class
  - [Group Project](https://github.com/Breakout-Room-2/lol-tracker) working with the api key from the 2nd powershell script to emulate (again a LoL-based project)
- **Vim**
  - Used it out of necessity for CSE classes (required) at first but found the key binding ***irreplaceble*** once they became familiar 
  - [vimrc](https://github.com/maniacalhamster/Preferences/blob/master/.vimrc) with the configs I like to use.

## Other stuff about me

When I'm not working on any projects, I like to spend the rest of my free time 
- watching anime and reading manga 
- playing/making piano arrangments of VGM (usually dumbed down) 
- playing video games 
- watching youtube shitposts.

That's the end of the user page, the rest is just random stuff to fulfill the checklist for the lab.

and/or [click here to go the README](.\README) 

Also here's a couple Hello Worlds:

``` java
public static void main(String[] args){
  System.out.println("Hello World");
}
```

``` c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
  cout << "Hello World";
}
```

``` py
print("Hello World");
```

``` ps1
Write-Host "Hello World";
```

Not that impressive, afterall Bruce Lee did say
> I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times
